# Tech Stack
The Re-mind ðŸ§  App leverages the following technologies to deliver a seamless user experience:

- Kotlin: The primary programming language used for developing the application. Kotlin offers concise syntax, null safety, and interoperability with existing Java code.

- Jetpack Compose: The modern declarative UI toolkit for building user interfaces in Android. Jetpack Compose simplifies UI development with its composable nature and reactive programming model.

- Multiplatform Desktop: The app utilizes Kotlin's multiplatform capabilities to target desktop platforms, including macOS. This enables a consistent codebase and UI across different platforms.

- JetBrains Exposed: A lightweight SQL library built specifically for Kotlin. Exposed provides a convenient and intuitive way to interact with SQLite databases, making data storage and retrieval efficient and seamless.

- Kotlin Coroutines: An asynchronous programming framework that simplifies concurrency and asynchronous operations. Kotlin Coroutines enable smooth and non-blocking execution of tasks, enhancing the app's performance and responsiveness.

By incorporating these technologies into the Re-mind ðŸ§  App, I ensured a robust, efficient, and user-friendly experience for DSA revision.
